# WinApp_With_BingMaps
Using windows 8.1 standard Grid Application and incorporating Bing Maps.

User will need their own BingMaps key https://www.microsoft.com/maps/create-a-bing-maps-key.aspx 

Project requires the following Extension:
- Bing Maps SDK for Windows 8.1 Store apps. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Microsoft-BingMapsTeam.BingMapsSDKforWindows81Storeapps

I have omitted my Bing Maps Key and added Referance ("Enter your own BingMaps Key") to where your key is required.
